# FastMCP Documentation

Welcome to the FastMCP documentation section.

## Overview

FastMCP is a Fast Model Context Protocol implementation that enables efficient communication between AI models and applications. It provides a streamlined interface for context management and model interactions.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol designed to standardize how applications communicate with AI models. It handles:

- Context management
- Message formatting
- Model selection
- Response streaming
- Error handling

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and low latency
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for quick implementation
- **Flexible**: Support for multiple model providers
- **Type-Safe**: Built with type safety in mind
- **Async Support**: Native async/await support for better concurrency

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install fastmcp
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Initialize the MCP client
mcp = FastMCP(
    model="gpt-4",
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Send a message
response = await mcp.chat(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
    ]
)

print(response.content)
```

## Core Concepts

### Context Management

FastMCP maintains conversation context automatically:

```python
# Context is maintained across calls
await mcp.chat("What is Python?")
await mcp.chat("What are its main features?")  # Remembers previous context
```

### Streaming Responses

Stream responses for better user experience:

```python
async for chunk in mcp.stream_chat("Tell me a story"):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

### Custom Configuration

Configure behavior for your specific needs:

```python
mcp = FastMCP(
    model="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=1000,
    timeout=30
)
```

## Advanced Features

- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Maintain context across multiple exchanges
- **Function Calling**: Enable models to call external functions
- **Token Management**: Automatic token counting and management
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to prevent API overuse
- **Caching**: Response caching for improved performance

## Best Practices

1. Always handle errors gracefully
2. Use streaming for long-form responses
3. Implement proper token management
4. Set appropriate timeouts
5. Monitor API usage and costs

## Use Cases

- **Chatbots**: Build conversational AI applications
- **Content Generation**: Generate articles, code, or creative content
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze and summarize large text datasets
- **Code Assistance**: Provide intelligent code suggestions
